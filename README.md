# Description

This project contains a code for a very simple online store app made in React with TypeScript and Redux.

## Usage

1. To choose products and their desired quantity for a basket navigate to **Sklep**;
2. To choose a desired quantity use **+** and **-** buttons underneath each product image;
3. To add product items to a basket click **Dodaj do koszyka**;
4. To see basket items with desired quantities navigate to **Koszyk**;
5. To remove product items click **USUŃ** (this is a full removal);
6. You can add items to a cart multiple times.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

### **TBA**

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

# Miscellaneous

## Create React App usage

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This means built-in **jest**, **webpack** and **babel** installations (see ```node_modules``` folder).
